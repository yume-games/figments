Always Together Font

Hi, thanks for downloading my font Always Together and I hope you like it. Remember: it's free for personal and commercial use! Hey, like me on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Skomii.PauloR to know more about me and what I'm doing.

Some things about the font you must know:

* This font has support for more than 40 languages;
* It comes with Stylistic Alternates, Stylistic Sets and other OpenType Features that you can use in programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and many others...

If you like the font a lot, you can make a donation of any value, just to make me smile and know I did something great.

The font Always Together was designed by Paulo R in 2014.

For my little Matteo and my newborn first nephew Christopher A. J. Nubre... :D
